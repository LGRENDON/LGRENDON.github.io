## 

**Greetings!** I’m Luis Gerardo Rendón Tapia, a mechatronics engineering student at Tecnológico de Monterrey with a specialization in aeronautics. Beyond my academic and technical pursuits, I enjoy hiking, swimming, going to the gym, and taking my dog on long walks—activities that keep me balanced, energized, and focused.

## Skills and Expertise

I bring strong proficiency in CAD tools (SolidWorks, Fusion 360, Onshape), programming (Python, MATLAB, C/C++, ROS, Arduino), and hands-on experience with multimeters, oscilloscopes, CNC machines, and 3D printers. I’m fluent in Spanish, proficient in English (B2), and learning German (A1).

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

As a Project Manager while studying my last year of the university, I lead teams through all stages of product development—from ideation to implementation. Whether it’s designing AGVs for industrial partners like John Deere or prototyping 3D-modeled aircraft, I take pride in solving real-world challenges through structured planning, creative engineering, and agile execution.

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

While I operate globally—such as contributing to the first Latin American FRC robot to reach the world championship finals—I remain grounded in creating meaningful impact locally, mentoring students and developing engineering solutions tailored to real-world needs.

## Continuous Learning

I’m deeply committed to lifelong learning. Whether it’s earning certifications like CSWP in SolidWorks and ABB’s RobotStudio, or exploring new technologies in automation, CAD, and control systems, I constantly seek opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.

## Collaboration and Communication

Through my experience as a project manager in tech initiatives and as a mentor in robotics, I’ve learned the value of clear communication and teamwork. I thrive in interdisciplinary teams, bringing together diverse skills to solve complex problems effectively.
