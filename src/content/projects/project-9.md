title: ABB - Automated Cell for welding processes
description: Proposed a fully autonomous robotic cell for laser welding, designed to eliminate human intervention. Created fixtures for conveyor-based part placement and a dual gripper to streamline piece transport, improving speed and efficiency. Utilized RobotStudio for movement programming and simulation, and SolidWorks for cell, fixture, and gripper design.
