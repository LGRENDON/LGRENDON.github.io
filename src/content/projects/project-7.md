**This project was part of a historic achievement:** 

I'm very proud of my contribution with the first robot in Latinamerica that goes to Einstein (worlds finals)
The team became the first Latin American robot to reach the world championship finals at the FIRST Robotics Competition, standing out among more than 3,600 teams from around the globe. Contributing to the design and manufacturing of the elevator subsystem played a key role in the robot’s performance, enabling precise and reliable scoring throughout the competition. This milestone not only highlighted the team’s engineering capabilities, but also marked a significant moment for Latin America in one of the world’s most prestigious youth robotics events.

**Project Overview:**

This project involved mentoring a high school robotics team competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)—an international engineering challenge where students design, build, and program industrial-sized robots to perform specific game tasks. As part of the mentorship, I guided the team through the design and fabrication of a robot elevator subsystem, a critical mechanism used to lift game elements to various heights. The project focused on teaching students practical skills in mechanical design, CAD modeling, and manufacturing, helping them turn their ideas into functional components ready for competition.

## Objectives

1. To mentor a high school robotics team participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in the end-to-end development of a robot elevator subsystem.
2. Guide students in applying engineering design principles, CAD modeling, and manufacturing techniques to build a functional and competition-ready component.
3. Foster technical skill growth, team collaboration, and problem-solving mindset in real-world engineering challenges.


## Features

1. **Custom-designed dual-stage elevator**
   - Capable of lifting game elements to high-scoring zones with precision.
   - Designed for lightweight performance using aluminum profiles and 3D-printed mounts.

2. **Full 3D parametric CAD model**
   - Developed using SolidWorks and Fusion 360, complete with assembly constraints and manufacturing drawings.

3. **Cable-driven linear motion system**
   - Ensured smooth extension/retraction with reduced backlash and tensioning mechanisms.

4. **Iterative prototyping and testing**
   - Included physical mockups, simulations, and design reviews with students for continuous improvement.

5. **Integration with wrist subsystem**
   - Synchronized vertical and rotational movements for optimized game interaction.


## Technology Stack

- CAD Software: SolidWorks and Fusion 360.
- Manufacturing : CNC mill, FDM 3D printers, laser cutters, hand tools.
- Simulation & Analysis: Basic structural simulation and load testing.
- Version Control & Collaboration: Google Drive, Discord.

## Outcome
-Delivered a fully functional, competition-legal elevator that performed reliably during FRC matches.

-Team successfully integrated the subsystem into their robot, contributing to higher match performance in autonomous and teleoperated phases.

-Students gained hands-on experience in mechanical design, tolerance management, and fabrication, with mentorship emphasizing real-world engineering standards and design for manufacturing (DFM).

-Strengthened the team's confidence in tackling complex mechanical challenges independently in future seasons.

**Note:** This Robot was not entirely designed by me, I was involved at elevator and wirst subsystem as mentor.
