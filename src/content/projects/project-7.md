**This project was part of a historic achievement:** 

The team became the first Latin American robot to reach the world championship finals at the FIRST Robotics Competition, standing out among more than 3,600 teams from around the globe. Contributing to the design and manufacturing of the elevator subsystem played a key role in the robot’s performance, enabling precise and reliable scoring throughout the competition. This milestone not only highlighted the team’s engineering capabilities, but also marked a significant moment for Latin America in one of the world’s most prestigious youth robotics events.

**Project Overview:**

This project involved mentoring a high school robotics team competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)—an international engineering challenge where students design, build, and program industrial-sized robots to perform specific game tasks. As part of the mentorship, I guided the team through the design and fabrication of a robot elevator subsystem, a critical mechanism used to lift game elements to various heights. The project focused on teaching students practical skills in mechanical design, CAD modeling, and manufacturing, helping them turn their ideas into functional components ready for competition.

## Objectives

1. To mentor a high school robotics team participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in the end-to-end development of a robot elevator subsystem.
2. Guide students in applying engineering design principles, CAD modeling, and manufacturing techniques to build a functional and competition-ready component.
3. Foster technical skill growth, team collaboration, and problem-solving mindset in real-world engineering challenges.


## Features

1. **Custom-designed elevator system:**

- CryptoTrader Dashboard aggregates data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to view their entire portfolio in one centralized location.
- Real-time updates provide the latest market prices, trading volumes, and order book data.

2. **Full 3D parametric CAD model:**

- Users can analyze their portfolio's performance through interactive charts and graphs.
- The dashboard offers insights into historical performance, asset allocation, and profit/loss over time.

3. **Implementation of cable-driven linear motion:**

- Advanced risk management tools help users assess the volatility and potential risks associated with their cryptocurrency investments.
- Users receive alerts for significant market fluctuations or changes in their portfolio value.

4. **iterative design reviews:**

- The dashboard automatically tracks and records users' cryptocurrency transactions, simplifying the process of updating and managing portfolios.
- Users can categorize transactions, add notes, and maintain a comprehensive transaction history.

5. **News and Market Insights:**

## Technology Stack

- CAD Software: SolidWorks and Fusion 360.
- Manufacturing : CNC mill, FDM 3D printers, laser cutters, hand tools.
- Simulation & Analysis: Basic structural simulation and load testing.
- Version Control & Collaboration: Google Drive, Discord.

## Outcome
-Delivered a fully functional, competition-legal elevator that performed reliably during FRC matches.

-Team successfully integrated the subsystem into their robot, contributing to higher match performance in autonomous and teleoperated phases.

-Students gained hands-on experience in mechanical design, tolerance management, and fabrication, with mentorship emphasizing real-world engineering standards and design for manufacturing (DFM).

-Strengthened the team's confidence in tackling complex mechanical challenges independently in future seasons.

**Note:** This Robot was not entirely designed by me, I was involved at elevator and wirst subsystem as mentor.
